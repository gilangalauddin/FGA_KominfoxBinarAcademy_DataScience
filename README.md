# FGA Kominfo x Binar Academy Data Science Course 2023

This repository contains the results of my work during the Data Science Bootcamp by Binar Academy, sponsored by Kominfo. Unfortunately, my groupmate abandoned the bootcamp, so I completed the assignments independently.

## Project 1: COVID-19 Data Analysis

### Data Source
I was provided with a COVID-19 dataset for Indonesia, which I queried using Google BigQuery. Due to limitations in exporting queries, you can access the dataset and the specific queries I used through the following link:

### Looker Studio Dashboard
As part of the project, I created a Looker Studio (formerly Google Data Studio) dashboard using the COVID-19 dataset. The dashboard is designed to answer questions related to the dataset. You can view the dashboard by clicking this image:

I understand that Tableau is one of the most popular dashboarding platforms in the industry. I am currently working on creating a Tableau version of the COVID-19 dashboard to provide additional visualization options. Stay tuned for updates on this exciting addition!

## Project 2: Customer Churn Prediction

For the second challenge, I worked on customer churn prediction using two datasets: data training and data test.

### Machine Learning Model
I built a machine learning model with a predictive algorithm to predict customer churn. The model used the data training set for training and was then evaluated on the data test set to assess its performance.

[Data Test](https://github.com/gilangalauddin/FGA_KominfoxBinarAcademy_DataScience/blob/master/Data%20Test.csv)

### Code and Results
The code for the machine learning model, along with the results and evaluation metrics, can be found in the following Jupyter Notebook:

## Conclusion

These projects were a part of my journey in the Data Science Bootcamp by Binar Academy. I learned valuable skills in data analysis, data visualization, and machine learning, and I'm excited to continue my data science journey.
