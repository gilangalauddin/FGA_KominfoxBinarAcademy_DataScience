# FGA Kominfo x Binar Academy Data Science Course 2023

This repository contains the results of my work during the Data Science Bootcamp by Binar Academy, sponsored by Kominfo. Unfortunately, my groupmate abandoned the bootcamp, so I completed the assignments independently.

## Project 1: COVID-19 Data Analysis

### Data Query
For the first challenge, we were tasked with writing queries to extract specific data from the COVID-19 dataset. Due to limitations in exporting queries from Google BigQuery, you can access the dataset and my queries through the following link:

### Dashboard Creation
Additionally, we were required to create a Looker Studio (formerly Google Data Studio) dashboard using the COVID-19 dataset. The dashboard was designed to not only visualize the data but also answer specific questions. You can view the Looker Studio dashboard here:

### Tableau Version
Recognizing the popularity of Tableau for dashboard creation, I also created a Tableau version of the dashboard. You can access the Tableau dashboard through this link:

## Project 2: Customer Churn Prediction

For the second challenge, I worked on customer churn prediction using two datasets: data training and data test.

### Machine Learning Model
I built a machine learning model with a predictive algorithm to predict customer churn. The model used the data training set for training and was then evaluated on the data test set to assess its performance.

[Data Test](https://github.com/gilangalauddin/FGA_KominfoxBinarAcademy_DataScience/blob/master/Data%20Test.csv)

### Code and Results
The code for the machine learning model, along with the results and evaluation metrics, can be found in the following Jupyter Notebook:

## Conclusion

These projects were a part of my journey in the Data Science Bootcamp by Binar Academy. I learned valuable skills in data analysis, data visualization, and machine learning, and I'm excited to continue my data science journey.
